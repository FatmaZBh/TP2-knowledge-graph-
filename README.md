# TP2-knowledge-graph-

This is my work for the tp2 for knowledge graph.

I submitted using my terminal.

The following files represent  : 
- query 1 neo4j; query 2 ; query 3 : the 3 queries in neo4j in screenshots 
- "recommandations and improvements.txt" : You'll find here the resoponses to the two questions in max 200 characters.
- Contstraints neo4j: constraints neo4j in screenshot
- health query : screenshot of the result of curl http://localhost:8000/health
- terminal testing: screenshot of other results (optional / bonus ) to verify that my code worked 

Thanks. 

Fatma BRAHAM.
